This loads your Child 1 remote as a standalone custom element (Angular element) â€” which means:

Angular bootstraps a completely new application instance inside the web componentâ€™s shadow DOM.

That app has its own Angular injector, its own zone, and its own DI tree.

Therefore, ShareStoreDataService in the web component is a separate instance from the hostâ€™s.

ðŸ’¥ â†’ Your singleton @shared/share-store-data no longer applies because itâ€™s not part of the same runtime scope.
